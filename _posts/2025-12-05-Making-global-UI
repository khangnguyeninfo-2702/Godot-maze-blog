Welcome back to another devlog! 🚀  
This week’s adventure? A deep dive into **UI magic, scene shenanigans**, and a surprising amount of **floating triangles causing chaos**.

## 🎛️ A Quest for Seamless Settings

So, here’s the problem I wanted to solve:

I’ve built a bunch of menus—main menu, shop, settings, pause menu—you name it. But I wanted the *settings menu* to be accessible directly from the pause menu **without restarting the entire game** when leaving it.

Godot, however, went:  
> “Oh, you want to open another scene while paused? How about I... restart everything instead?”

Not ideal.

### 💡 The Big Brain Solution: Global UIs

After watching some other devs’ clever approaches, I realized:  
**Why not just spawn the settings menu at startup, disable it, and toggle it on/off whenever I need it?**

Brilliant!  
…in theory.

## 🧩 Problem #1: “Why Can’t I Click Anything?”

Everything was loaded. Everything was visible. And yet—no clicks.  
The settings menu simply refused to acknowledge my existence.

Why?

- The settings menu was on a CanvasLayer.
- It instantiated at game startup.
- Which meant: **it lived *under* the pause menu.**
- Even with `process_mode = ALWAYS`, it still lost the click war.

### ☑️ Fix:
I bumped its CanvasLayer to Layer **2**.  
Suddenly—clicks everywhere. Victory.

## 🌀 Problem #2: Duplicate Physics Backgrounds = Disaster

Every menu in my game has:
- Its own UI background
- And a physics-based background with floating squares and triangles (because static menus are boring!)

But when the settings menu spawned globally:
- I could hide the UI…
- But the physics background refused to stop moving or despawn.

Result?  
**Two entire physics backgrounds existing at once.**  
Floating shapes colliding with other floating shapes.  
Full-on polygon mayhem.

I’ve seen this nightmare before—and escaped it.  
But this time?

### ☑️ Fix:
I promoted the physics background to its own global UI too.  
One background to rule them all. 😎

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to create and manage **global UIs**  
- How to cleanly **enable/disable UI scenes** without spaghetti  
- How to maintain a **smooth and consistent menu system** across the whole game

Plus, I finally solved my ancient problem of having *two separate settings menus* (one in the main menu, one in-game). Now I have **one unified, smarter settings menu**. No more scene resets. No more duplication. No more pain.

## 🔮 Next Steps

Now that the UI architecture is polished and future-proof:

- 🎇 Time to dive into **fragment mechanics**!  
- 🌍 And soon… start crafting the **3D world**. (I hope. Pray for me.)

Thanks for following along—more exciting chaos coming soon!  
See you in Devlog #11!
